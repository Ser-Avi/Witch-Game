<b>Narration:</b> I never felt like life had a greater purpose, or that I may have some great calling, until I started running this place. 
<b>Narration:</b> Before settling here, life was a series of misadventures and nomadic traveling from town to town, trading magical favors for food and shelter.
<b>Narration:</b> When I came here, to [this town], I thought it'd be the same-old same-old. It wasn't.
<b>Narration:</b> What started out as helping a few people here and there with their troubles soon grew to be helping the whole neighborhood. 
<b>Narration:</b> Once, when a pack of forest-dwelling werewolves began attacking livestock, it was my enchanted silver arrows that helped the townspeople drive them away.
<b>Narration:</b> From there, things were different. People... trusted me. They relied on me, something I didn't know if I really wanted but couldn't exactly turn my back on. So, I opened up shop. 
<b>Narration:</b> For all of its imperfections, and all of my backfired spells, failed brews, and broken beakers I love this shop.
<b>Narration:</b> With every person I've helped here, I've appreciated my craft more, <i>much</i> more than whatever price I'd been willing to slap on it before.
