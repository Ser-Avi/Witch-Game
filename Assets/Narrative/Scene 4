<b>The House </b>
<b> Direction Note:</b> <i>Black screen, background muisc</i>

<b>Narration:</b> After my curious guest leaves, I spend the night researching the little literature I have on necromancy, resurrection, and reanimation--all things death and abject abomination.
<b>Alma:</b> "According to <i>Vetiti Artes et Ritus</i>..."
<b>Narration:</b> I spoke to Gus who sat attentively on the counter, listening as I read from the stiff leather-bound book in my hands.
<b>Alma:</b> "Once a body is past the <i>rigor mortis</i> stage, resssurrection is... Possible, but not ideal. You risk bringing back a consciousless, non-sentient corpse. One that doesn't know who they are--er, <i>were</i>--and that is still going through the stages of decomposition. Nasty stuff."
<b>Narration:</b> I glance down at the floor. I imagined having to clean that fluid bodies escrete after they bloat up off the hardwood.
<b>Narration:</b> I missed Dreya and her simple rashes and arthritic bones.
<b>Alma:</b> "Without a body, though, it is possible to bring back the deceased's spirit, but only temporary."
<b>Alma:</b> "With no body to enter, the spirit has nothing coporeal to hold onto."
<b>Narration:</b> It wasn't what <b>that man</b> wanted, but maybe this was the answer.
<b>Narration:</b> I close the book and look down at Gus.
<b>Gus:</b> <i>Squeak</i>
