<b>The House </b>
<b>Direction Note:</b> <i>House background, Alma quarter pose fade in</i>

<b>Narration:</b> Still settling into my decision, the <i>jingle</i> of the front door opening catches my attention.
<b>Narration:</b> My nervous eyes watch the strange man from yesterday wander back into the shop. I flicker my eyes towards the clock. Back, almost exactly 24 hours later.
<b>Alma:</b> (Punctual.)
<b>???:</b> "Have you made a decision?"
<b>Narration:</b> My answer sits like a stone in my chest. I swallow hard."
<b>Alma:</b> "I have. I cannot help you."
<b>Narration:</b> I look him in the eye as I deliver the news.
<b>Alma:</b> "I'm sorry."
<b>Narration:</b> He says nothing for a beat, his intense eyes staring at me blankly mine. I drop my gaze to the floor."
<b>???:</b> "Why?"
<b>Alma:</b> "I don't have the knowledge to execute the ritual successfully. The whole thing could blow up in my face if I tried."
<b>???:</b> "So, you're scared to try?"
<b>Alma:</b> "... Somewhat, yes."
<b>Narration:</b> I don't see the point in lying to him now.
<b>Narration:</b> Though it isn't just the 'what if this whole thing blows up in my face, literally' portion that I was nervous about.
<b>Narration:</b> What if, for all the time I've spent building this little business, honing my craft, becoming a witch whose name carries to towns over, I'm plainly not good enough? That I'm no different than the witch I was when I first rolled into town?
<b>Narration:</b> I couldn't bear a reality where all of the time I've spent doing what I love was for nothing.
<b>Narration:</b> ...
<b>Narration:</b> But, was that the type of witch I was?
<b>Narration:</b> I couldn't remember a time when I've let fear rule my decisions. Not when I was on the road. Not when I opened up shop.
<b>Narration:</b> The man turns to leave, nodding his head at me and offering a wave goodbye.
<b>Alma:</b> "... Wait!"
<b>Alma:</b> "I can try. I can't guarantee anything, but I can try."
<b>Alma:</b> "If we did the ritual, I couldn't bring your friend back fully. Not permanently, either."
<b>Alma:</b> "I could only bring his spirit back, and just for a short while. How does that sound?"
<b>Narration:</b> The man stands quietly for some time, thinking.
<b>???:</b> "What do you mean by his spirit?'
<b>Alma:</b> "The 'essence of his soul', basically."
<b>???:</b> "Would he still be himself?"
<b>Narration:</b> At this, I shrugged and tilted my head a bit.
<b>Alma:</b> "Not quiet sure. From what I've read, it seems to be a bit different for everybody. There's no telling what he would look like, or how he may act. Only that he'd be an incoporeal being, unable to physically interact with our material world."
<b>???:</b> "So like a ghost?"
<b>Alma:</b> "Yeah. Like a ghost."
<b>???:</b> "And you couldn't bring him back forever?"
<b>Narration:</b> I shook my head.
<b>Alma:</b> "No. Eventually, he'd have to go back to wherever he belongs to now."
<b>???:</b> "After how long?"
<b>Alma:</b> "No telling. Could be days or weeks, or seconds. Depends on how long a spirit can cling onto our plane of existence."
<b>???:</b> "..."
<b>Alma:</b> "... It likely wouldn't be for long, though, given that this would be my first attempt at summoning a spirit. Limitations of power and all that."
<b>???:</b> "..."
<b>Alma:</b> "I get that this is a lot to digest at once. If you need time to think it over--"
<b>???:</b> "Okay."
<b>Alma:</b> "!"
<b>???:</b> "I want to go through with it."
<b>???:</b> "Let's bring Simon back."
<b>Narration:</b> I shake the man's hand as he offers it, reflecting back his smile while my nerves eat away at me.
<b>Narration:</b> Even though I've signed on, doubt courses throughout me.
<b>Narration:</b> What if I mess up? What if the ritual fails? 
<b>Narration:</b> ... What if I'm a witch who's not worth her salt?
<b>Narration:</b> ...
<b>Narration:</b> There's no turning back now, I guess.
<b>Narration:</b> Only going forward.
<b>Narration:</b> I look down at the hand I'm shaking. I still don't know who it belongs to.
<b>Alma:</b> "Before we get started, who are you? You never gave me your name."
<b>Narration:</b> The man stiffens a bit, slowly taking his hand back.
<b>???:</b> "You're right, I haven't. Forgive me, that was rude of me."
<b>???:</b> "My name is <b>Jonah</b>."
