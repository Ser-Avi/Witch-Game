<b>Narration:</b> The cauldron boils rapidly. A light honeysuckle scent wafts from the mixture.
<b>Narration:</b> I continue chanting.
<b>Alma:</b> "<i>...Obsecro te. Obsecro te. Obsecro te...</i>"
<b>Alma:</b> (That's odd...)
<b>Narration:</b> Without warning, the cauldron boils faster, beyond my control til it's spilling over the sides. I can't hear myself speak over the sound of the water's rapid gurgling.
<b>Narration:</b> The smell of decay hits me suddenly. I can't help but to plug my nose, and whip my face away from the cauldron. 
<b>Narration:</b> I close my eyes, tears forming beyond my control from the foul stench radiating towards me.
<b>Jonah:</b> "Is that... A finger?"
<b>Narration:</b> I look up at Jonah then over at the cauldron.
<b>Narration:</b> Before my eyes, a disembodied finger rises up above the water as it drops from a boil to a cold stop.
<b>Narration:</b> Ritual failed.
