<b>The House </b>
<b>Direction Note:</b> <i>House background, Alma quarter pose fade in</i>

<b>Narration:</b> Still settling into my decision, the <i>jingle</i> of the front door opening catches my attention.
<b>Narration:</b> My nervous eyes watch the strange man from yesterday wander back into the shop. I flicker my eyes towards the clock. Back, almost exactly 24 hours later.
<b>Alma:</b> (Punctual.)
<b>???:</b> "Have you made a decision? Will you help me?"
<b>Narration:</b> My answer sits like a stone in my chest.
<b>Alma:</b> "Yes. Yes, I will help you."
<b>Narration:</b> The words flow out as a landslide past my lips.
<b>???:</b> "That's... That's great news! Thank you!"
<b>Narration:</b> I hear a smile in his voice, though I can't see it behind his bushy beard.
<b>Alma:</b> "Don't mention it. Not yet, anyway."
<b>Alma:</b> "I can't... Bring your friend back fully. Not permanently, anyway."
<b>Alma:</b> "I can only bring his spirit back, and just for a short while. How does that sound?"
<b>Narration:</b> The man stands quietly for some time, thinking.
<b>???:</b> "What do you mean by his spirit?'
<b>Alma:</b> (Great question.)
<b>Alma:</b> "The 'essence of his soul', basically."
<b>???:</b> "Will he still be himself?"
<b>Narration:</b> At this, I shrugged and tilted my head a bit."
<b>Alma:</b> "Not quiet sure. From what I've read, it seems to be a bit different for everybody. There's no telling what he will look like, or how he will act. Only that he'll be an incoporeal being, unable to physically interact with our material world."
<b>???:</b> "So like a ghost?"
<b>Alma:</b> "Yeah. Like a ghost."
<b>???:</b> "And you can't bring him back permanently?"
<b>Narration:</b> I shook my head.
<b>Alma:</b> "No. Eventually, he'll go back to wherever he belongs now."
<b>???:</b> "After how long?"
<b>Alma:</b> "No telling. Could be days or weeks, or seconds. It depends on how long the spirit clings onto our plane."
<b>???:</b> "..."
<b>Alma:</b> "... It likely wouldn't be for long, though, given that this would be my first attempt at summoning a spirit. Limitations of power and all that."
<b>???:</b> "..."
<b>Alma:</b> "I get that this is a lot to digest at once. If you need time to think it over--"
<b>???:</b> "Okay."
<b>Alma:</b> "!"
<b>???:</b> "I want to go through with it."
<b>???:</b> "Let's bring Simon back."
<b>Narration:</b> I shake the man's hand as he offers it, reflecting back his smile while my nerves eat away at me.
<b>Narration:</b> Even though I've signed on, doubt courses throughout me.
<b>Narration:</b> What if I mess up? What if the ritual fails? 
<b>Narration:</b> ... What if I'm a witch who's not worth her salt?
<b>Narration:</b> ...
<b>Narration:</b> There's no turning back now, I guess.
<b>Narration:</b> Only going forward.
<b>Narration:</b> I look down at the hand I'm shaking. I still don't know who it belongs to.
<b>Alma:</b> "Before we get started, who are you? You never gave me your name."
<b>Narration:</b> The man stiffens a bit, slowly taking his hand back.
<b>???:</b> "You're right, I haven't. Forgive me, that was rude of me."
<b>???:</b> "My name is <b>Jonah</b>."
