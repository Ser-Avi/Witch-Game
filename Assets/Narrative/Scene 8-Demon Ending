<b>Narration:</b> The cauldron boils rapidly. A light honeysuckle scent wafts from the mixture.
<b>Narration:</b> I continue chanting.
<b>Alma:</b> "<i>...Obsecro te. Obsecro te. Obsecro te...</i>"
<b>Alma:</b> (That's odd...)
<b>Narration:</b> Without warning, the cauldron boils faster, beyond my control til it's spilling over the sides. I can't hear myself speak over the sound of the water's rapid gurgling
<b>Narration:</b> The smell of decay hits me suddenly. I can't help but to plug my nose, and whip my face away from the cauldron. 
<b>Narration:</b> I close my eyes, tears forming beyond my control from the foul stench radiating towards me.
<b>Jonah:</b> "Is that... No...!"
<b>Narration:</b> I look up at Jonah then over at the cauldron.
<b>Jonah:</b> "Oh god, <i>no!</i>"
<b>Narration:</b> A grotesque <b>demon</b> rises from the cauldron, the water now brought to a cold stop.
<b>Jonah:</b> "<b>The monster</b>!--"
<b>Narration:</b> I barely hear Jonah's faint yell as I am throttled into a sudden, inescapable darkness.
<b>Narration:</b> ...
<b>Narration:</b> Ritual failed.
