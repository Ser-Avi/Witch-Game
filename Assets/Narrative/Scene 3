<b>The House </b>
<b> Direction Note:</b> <i>Black screen, background muisc</i>
<b>Direction Note:</b> <i>House background and Alma quarter pose fade in</i>

<b>Narration:</b>Lost in my reflections I, my ears barely catch the the <i>jingle</i> of the front door opening.
<b>Alma:</b>"Welcome into Swan Song Apothecary, how can I help yo--"

<b>Direction Note:</b> <i>Background music fade to mysterious music. Background darkens.</i>
<b>Alma:</b> (</i>Geez</i>, they're tall.)
<b>Narration:</b> Light pours through the clear window behind them, bringinng rainbow prisms to their dark dress--Pants. Tunic. Cape, strangely, with the hood drawn up. Light floods through the whole room even as the door comes to its <i>jingling</i> close, yet here this stranger stands in my shop like a hushed black hole.
<b>Alma:</b>"Um, welcome in...! How can I help you?"
<b>???:</b>"You're a witch?"
<b>Narration:</b>He's rather softspoken despite his intimidating presence.
<b>Alma:</b>"Uh, yeah. If the pointy hat and magic potions don't give it away."
<b>Narration:</b>Shadows cast below his hood completely mask the man's face, but he sounds like an older gent.
<b>Alma:</b>"And who might you be? I haven't seen you in before."
<b>Narration:</b>I'm caught off-guard by the unfamiliar face, but don't want to be rude to my guest.
<b>???:</b>"So you can do magic?"
<b>Alma:</b>"All sorts! I mainly work in alchemy--potions, brews, that type of stuff--but I also practice your traditional sorcery."
<b>Narration:</b>A small fire ignites in the palm of my outstretched hand, held nice and high for him to see. I let the flames dance for a few moments before  disappearing them with a wave of my wrist. Creating fire out of thin air was a simple trick I picked up early on as a beginner mage. Typically, it was a crowd-pleaser.
<b>???:</b>"..."
<b>Narration:</b> No reaction.
<b>Alma:</b>"Looking for a spell, then? Time spell? Luck spell?"
<b>???:</b>"..."
<b>Alma:</b>"...<i>Love</i> spell?
<b>???:</b>"..."
<b>Alma:</b> (Worth a shot.)
<b>Alma:</b>"I can also summon creatures. Well, small creatures at least. That's how I met Gus."
<b>Narration:</b>Gus pokes his head out.
<b>???:</b>"..."
<b>Gus:</b> <i>Squeak</i>
<b>???:</b>"How much do you charge?"
<b>Alma:</b>"Depends...What exactly is it that you need? One thing I can't do is read minds."
<b>???:</b>"..."
<b>???:</b>"Can you... Bring back the dead?"
<b>Narration:</b>Now I found myself quiet.
<b>Alma:</b>"...You're looking for someone to perform a resurrection?"
<b>Narration:</b>He shifts around in his boots a little, moving his weight to his other leg.
<b>???:</b>"Yes."
<b>Alma:</b> "That...I cannot do. Sorry, friend."
<b>???:</b>"Why?"
<b>Narration:</b>The obvious disappointment in his voice isn't going to make me budge, unfortuately. 
<b>Alma:</b> "What you're asking for is way outside of my scope of knowledge; I've never performed a ressurrection before. I wouldn't know where to start." 
<b>Narration:</b> Partially true. I <i>haven't</i> performed a ressurrectionn before, but I have at least a few books on the topic somewhere. 
<b>Narration:</b> Regardless, I'm not looking to get my eyebrows blown off or to summon a horde of locusts or <i>whatever</i> consequences come from a backfired ressurection attempt.
<b>Alma:</b> "Sorry."
<b>???:</b>"Please."
<b>Narration:</b> The man steps further into the store, revealing a gruff face as he unveils his hood.
<b>Narration:</b> He's all beard and wide, bright eyes. Pockmarks decorate his puffy cheeks and broad forehead. 
<b>Narration:</b> Up close in the light, desparation runs across the man's face, his furrowed eyebrows drawn close together, worrylines etched onto his forehead.
<b>???:</b>"Please, help me."
<b>Narration:</b> The whole reason why I started this business was to help people with their unique, often magical conundrums. 
<b>Narration:</b> I can't exactly turn away a desparate soul. 
<b>Narration:</b> ...Can I?

[[Who are you trying to ressurrect?]]
[[Who are you?]]
[[Why did you come to me?]]

<b>Narration:</b> I watch him for a minute, contemplating his request. 
<b>Narration:</b> A ressurrection is risky business, literally speaking. Who knows what could happen to my shop if a ritual like that failed?
<b>Narration:</b> Or if I even have the power to attempt it in the first place... 
<b>Narration:</b> Gus chippers in my pocket, bringing me out of my head and back to the man before me.
<b>Narration:</b> I take a deep breath. 
<b>Alma:</b> "Come back tomorrow. I'll have a decision for you then."
