<b>The House </b>

<b>Direction Note:</b><i> The sound of glass breaking across a hard surface. </i> 
<b> Alma: </b> “Please, don’t touch anything!”
<b> ???: </b> “Sorry!” 
<b>Alma, to herself:</b> (Now, where am I...? Bones of lamb's trotter, ginger root, bundle of nettle... Here it is!)
<i>Acquired item sound</i>

<b>Narration:</b> I hand over the bones of lamb's trotter, ginger root, bundle of nettle, and vile of spider's tears to Dreya, my patient (yet prying) customer.
<b>Alma:</b> "Boil these in a pot of hot water and consume when cooled everyday for a week. Should clear that cough right up." 
<b>Alma:</b> "Come back if that doesn't work." 
<b> Dreya: </b> “Thank you, dear! Don't know what I'd ever do without you."
<b>Alma:</b> "Don't mention it, Dreya. You know I'm always happy to help."
<b>Dreya:</b> "But, I must thank you! Here, for all your troubles."
<b>Narration:</b> From her wicker basket, Dreya pulls out a jar and gently sets it on the counter with her shaky hands. Syrupy droplets fall from the inner lid, collecting into a viscous, golden pool. 
<b>Dreya:</b> "It's fresh! Harvested just this morning."
<b>Narration:</b> The jar has some weight to it in my hand. A meticulously detailed logo of a honeybee stares back at me.
<b>Narration:</b> Dreya waves goodbye as she exists the shop, one slow step at a time. 
<b>Narration:</b> She's in here every so often, always a new ailment in tow. This time, sudden coughing fits. Last time, sharp pains in her hip. The beauty of growing older, I guess. 
<b>Narration:</b> The honey, still golden and glistening in its glass jar, almost makes up for whatever it is she broke earlier. Which I still need to find...
<b>Alma:</b> "...!"
<b>Narration:</b> Scouring the shop, I spot a broken beaker and its mysterious, green contents oozing onto the hardwood. 
<b>Narration:</b> Drawing closer to the spill, a pugent odor assaults my senses. The gaseous vapor rising from the liquid creates an odd atmosphere in this nook of the shop. 
<b>Narration:</b> The honey does <i>not</i> make up for this.
<b>Alma:</b> "Oogre's bile..."
<b>Alma:</b> "Should have charged her full price."
<b>Narration:</b> A sharp <i>squeak</i> of agreement rings from my pocket.
<b>Direction Note:</b><i>Mouse squeak sound</i>
<b>Alma:</b> "Sorry, bud. Didn't mean to wake you. But this mess--!"
<b>Gus:</b> "<i>Squeak</i>"
<b>Alma:</b> "I know, right? As sweet as she is, the woman has pesky hands."
<b>Narration:</b> Certainly not my first Dreya spill.
<b>Narration:</b> I head to the back office (aka my closet) and find some spare rags in the back to clean up the mess. Carefully, I throw away the shards of glass.
<b>Alma:</b> "No good deed goes unpunished, huh?"
<b>Gus:</b> "<i>Squeak</i>"
