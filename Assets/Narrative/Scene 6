<b>Narration:</b> Jonah and I stand in front of the cauldron, about to commence the ritual summoning. Before we can begin though, I need to gather more information about Simon.
<b>Alma:</b> "Tell me about Simon. I need to have a good idea of who he was to summon the right spirit."
<b>Jonah:</b> "What do you need to know?"
<b>Alma:</b> "Let's start with the basics. How did you know Simon?"
<b>Jonah:</b> "We were part of the same band."
<b>Alma:</b> "What did he play?"
<b>Jonah:</b> "Not that type of band!"
<b>Jonah:</b> "We were a band of travellers. Simon, myself, and a few others."
<b>Jonah:</b> "We'd go whereever the road took us, dropping people off, taking people on as they came, rolling from town to town..."
<b>Narration:</b> Jonah looks distracted, probably lost in memory.
<b>Jonah:</b> "We'd take on quests from locals in the towns we were passing through for money and food."
<b>Alma</b> (Sounds like me before I opened this shop.)

<b>Jonah:</b> "That's how Simon died... We were investigating a series of disappearances in a small village north of the mountains. We tracked <b>the monster</b> to the woods, but..."
<b>Jonah:</b> "...We thought that whatever was taking these people would be minor, you know? At least for us. Given what we've taken on before."
<b>Jonah:</b> "Thought the townspeople just weren't used to handling trolls, or ogres, or giant spiders, or whatever the hell we thought it was out there."
<b>Jonah:</b> "Boy... Were we wrong."
<b>Jonah:</b> "...Simon died fighting <b>that monster</b> when we found it. A few people did. Torn limb from limb." 
<b>Narration:</b> Silence befell us after Jonah's story.
<b>Narration:</b> Your companions being ripped away from you... I couldn't imagine. 
<b>Narration:</b> Gus' sharp squeak rang from my shoulder, and I scooped him up, placing him back in my pocket.
<b>Jonah:</b> "What else do you need to know?"
<b>Narration:</b>Tell me...
